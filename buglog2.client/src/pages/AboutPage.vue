            When you create a bug ticket you can track it through your Account, add notes and close it once the
            bug has been resolved. To get started just click the button on the "Home" that says "New Bug". It's pretty self
            explanitory from there. Thanks and have a great day.

            Once you've fixed("Squashed") your bug, the bug ticket will be closed. Make sure to do all your testing,
            because if you close it to early, you'll have to start another one! I know they're frustrating,
            but I'm sure you'll squash every single one!

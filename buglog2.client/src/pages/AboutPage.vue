    <h1>This application will let you create a bug ticket!</h1>
    <h4>
      When you create a bug ticket you can track it through your Account, add notes and close it once the
      bug has been resolved. To get started just click the button on the "Home" that says "New Bug". It's pretty self
      explanitory from there. Thanks and have a great day.
